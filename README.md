# Github Gists Finder App               

Find gists based on github username


### Tech

Gists Finder app uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* React
* Next JS - For server side rendering
* CSS Modules
* ESLint
* Airbnb ESLint
* Github API


### Installation

Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies.

```sh
$ npm install
```
Start the server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Build on local

```sh
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```


### Motive

This was a project built during an interview process. Project goals included using technologies learned and worked up until this point.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the github API based on username. I started this process by using the create-next-app boilerplate.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Next JS, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the create-next-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into other stuff. 

### Roadmap

 - Write unit tests
 - Add Night Mode
